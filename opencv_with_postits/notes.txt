other areas of possible detection

1.  Look for clear variation in colour
2.  Once squares are selected, detect bi-patterns in freq distribution
3.  Maybe only once these other filters are used, go greyscale/contour/generalise and angles

I wonder if there is a way to have a moving window and scan for clear changes in clour pattern... perhaps thats what the contours are doing....

need to investigate points of detection with current process.



WE HAVE TO TEACH IT!

use a few learning images with already marked out post-its and review the params found 

params to use...

1.  colour
2.  distribution in greyscale
3. ...
